    <h1>Ganymede Around the World Contest</h1>
    <p>
      We want to hear how you&#146;re using the Eclipse projects in the <a
        href="/ganymede/"
      >Ganymede</a> release. Write a blog post, create a screencast/video, or
      record a podcast telling the world what&#146;s great or what you dislike
      about Ganymede. For your efforts, we&#146;ll send you an Eclipse shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have posted your review, add it to the <a href="mapList.php">Ganymede
        Around the World map</a>. Eclipse is a global community, so we encourage
      you to create a review in your native language.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to show your support but don&#146;t have the time to prepare a
      review, you can still add yourself to the <a href="mapList.php">Ganymede
        Around the World map</a>. Just enter your name, address and a short
      message or image about how you use Eclipse. Everyone who adds their name
      will be entered into a random draw for 5 Eclipse jackets.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enter the contest, a review must be of sufficient technical content.
      Long essays aren&#146;t necessary, but as a guideline, include 3 to 5
      points of what you like or don&#146;t like about the Ganymede projects.
      The top 3 reviews will win an Eclipse jacket and the best entry will win
      their choice of a pass to <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2009/">EclipseCon
        2009</a> or <a href="http://eclipsesummit.org/summiteurope2008/">Eclipse
        Summit Europe 2008</a>!
    </p>
    <p>
      The deadline for submissions to the contest is <b>July 31, 2008</b>. The
      top 3 and best reviews will be selected by a panel of judges.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Important Details:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can submit multiple reviews but only one shirt per person will be
        sent.</li>
      <li>Shirt quantities are limited so shirts will be distributed to
        reviewers on a first come, first served basis.</li>
      <li>The EclipseCon or Eclipse Summit Europe pass only covers the
        conference registration. It does not include any travel expenses. The
        pass is non-transferable, non-refundable and has no cash value. If you
        can&#146;t go to either conference or you receive a free pass some other
        way (such as a speaker pass), you won&#146;t be able to take advantage
        of the prize.</li>
      <li>Informed, insightful, educated reviews &#150; positive and negative
        &#150; are always welcome. However, FUD-spewers, propagandists and
        mean-spirited curmudgeons need not apply.</li>
      <li>A review needs to be submitted to the <a href="mapList.php">Ganymede
          Around the World </a>map with an email address to participate in the
        contest.
